Scoutium Football Potential Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of football player potential using Scoutium data. The analysis encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, and the construction and evaluation of a Random Forest classifier model.

The notebook covers these main stages:
Data loading and merging
Data preprocessing and transformation
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Feature scaling
Building and evaluating a Random Forest classifier model
Customize and adapt the code to suit your specific analysis goals.

Analysis Steps
The analysis is divided into the following steps:

Data loading and merging
Data preprocessing and transformation
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Feature scaling
Building and evaluating a Random Forest classifier model
Results
The analysis provides insights into football player potential labels and constructs a predictive model to classify players' potential labels based on their attributes.

The final Random Forest model achieved an average accuracy of X%, an average F1-score of Y%, and an average ROC AUC score of Z% through cross-validation.
